    "introduction.description": "PointNXT is a template for background management systems designed for businesses, built with React and Ant Design. It uses the latest React Hooks API instead of the older class-based API, and we've included TypeScript to help keep the code easy to read and maintain, which boosts development speed. Redux is used for global state management. This project helps you quickly create a new project template and lets you remove some code based on your needs. If you don't need to use templates, this project is also a great resource for learning React and TypeScript. Additionally, if you think this project could be improved or changed, feel free to reach out; my contact info will be at the end of the article.",
